    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <p>I found these videos very interesting, especially because there is one basic principle 
    we all (designers/developers) need to consider when we program. I can say that the first 
    title contains the global idea: "How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX", and 
    that's so true! "Rewire our brain" is so hard for me, I mean, many times it is difficult 
    for me to acquire new habits.</p>
    <p>From the first time I have always started writing the code for desktop and then implement 
    the design for mobile and that is precisely the opposite of what the video suggests. The data 
    shown in the video suggests that we analyze the fact that today there are more mobile devices 
    than desktop computers. So, it is more convenient to focus on mobile design first; the result 
    of this is a simpler and more functional design. Many times less is more.</p>
    <p>The other videos talk about how to implement a design that fits the user's needs. From 
    how easy and brief the user's interaction with the interface should be, to how intuitive and 
    friendly the forms should be. And finally, I love one of the last suggestions: "Stop using 
    pop-ups", and I am totally agree. I don't know anyone who likes pop ups, they are very 
    annoying and spoil the user experience.</p>
