    <h2>VALIDATION FORMS</h2>

    <p>Validation is the way the browser and/or the server check the information the 
        user enters in the forms to see if that matches what is required and in a valid 
        format. Client-side validation is done in the browser while server-side validation 
        is done on the server. There are two ways of making client-side validation: using 
        built-in form validation and using Javascript.</p>
    
    <p>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form controls to check users entries without using 
        much Javascript. For example if we need an user's input to be required we can set the 
        "required" attribute in that input element. We can use the "minlength" and "maxlength" 
        to set a maximum and a minimum length of the input. Something we see a lot in the 
        elements is the "type" attribute which helps us specify the type of the input, such 
        as a number or an email address. We also can be more specific with the format of the 
        user input using regular expressions. </p>
    
    <p>The following code will make a form validation expecting the user to write one of four options: 
        Banana, banana, Cherry or cherry. If the user doesn't enter one of them an error message 
        will appear: "Please match the requested format". Also, if we set the input type to 
        "number" and the user enters a string it will get the same message<button id="openWindow">Show Code</button></p>

    
        
    <p>Form validation using Javascript is much more customizable and you can take control 
        over the error messages and more.</p>
