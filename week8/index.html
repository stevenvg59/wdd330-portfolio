    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>

    <p>I loved this chapter of transitions and animations, it is ideal for today's 
        web designs which demand that they be more dynamic and with more attractive 
        visual effects.</p>
    <h2>TRANSFORM</h2>
    
    <p>With the "transform" property we can translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew 
        any element on the page. There are transform functions such as translations, 
        scaling, rotation, and skew that help on that approach. You can add all these 
        functions inside the transform property line, like so:</p>
    
    <p>transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5) skew(15deg, 4deg);</p> 
    
    <h2>TRANSITION</h2>

    <p>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, which could 
        also be considered as a simple animation. They have some properties such as 
        transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. 
        For example this is the syntax for these properties:</p>
        
    <p>transition-property: transform; <br />
        transition-duration: 0.2s;  <br />
        transition-timing-function: ease-out;<br />
        transition-delay: 50ms;</p>

    <p>When we combine transitions with transforms we can get a more dynamic page.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Using the Canvas API we can draw anything we want only using Javascript. With canvas, 
            we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns.</li>
        <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to 
            describe vector graphics using XML. Unlike canvas, images created with SVG are available 
            via the DOM.</li>
        <li>The "Drag and Drop" API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and 
            then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped 
            onto other elements on the page.</li>          
    </ul>
