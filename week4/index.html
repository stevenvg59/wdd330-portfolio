    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>

    <p>One thing I learned from searching and digging a little bit more about forms 
        is that one of the reasons the Javascript programming language was created is 
        for forms, as it was necessary to validate form data without having to refresh 
        the page. Almost every web page we see and use today contains forms. In this 
        week's reading I was able to learn some very useful properties and methods when 
        using forms. It was very helpful to practice using not only text inputs but 
        also passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, and drop-down lists; all of this makes 
        it possible for the form, and the page in general, to have a better appearance 
        and be more dynamic. Something I was able to learn is about form validation, I 
        still need to practice more on this topic, specifically the validation of special 
        characters and dates. Most of them will be using using PHP which I understand that 
        it is not part of the front-end programming. </p>

    <p>This is a pretty simple but very easy to follow example of a form using JS:</p>
