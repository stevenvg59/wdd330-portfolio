    <h1>Week 7</h1>

    <h2>Textbook Chapter 11 Notes</h2>

    <p>Functions are first-class objects so they can have their own properties and methods. 
        Length(), call() and apply() are very useful methods that we can implement them so 
        that helps the functions are not tied to specific objects and are more flexible. 
        Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a function that is invoked as soon 
        as it's defined. Here is the syntax:</p>
    
    <p>(function(){<br />
        console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br />
        })();<br />
        << 'Hello World'</p>
    
    <p>One advantage of using IIFE is that we can have temporary variables (variables that 
        are only used in part of the program and then disappear) and do not overfill the code 
        with lots of variable names. We can also isolate blocks of code and keep variables with 
        the same name but without interfering with each other. For example:</p>
        
    <p>function(){<br />
        console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br />
        }();</p>
    
    <p><< 'Hello World'</p>

    <p>(function() {  <br />  
        // block A    <br />
        const name = 'Block A';  <br />  
        console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);   <br /> 
        }());<br />

        (function() { <br />   
        // block B   <br /> 
        const name = 'Block B'; <br />   
        console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);<br />
        }());<br />
        <<  Hello from Block A   <br /> 
        <<  Hello from Block B</p>

    <p>Both use the variable "name" but they are independent.</p>

    <p>I learned that we can use functions within functions and that variables used in outer 
        variables (variables declared in outer functions) can be also used within the inner 
        functions. This is a key example of using closures.</p>

    <p>function outer() { <br />      
        const outside = 'Outside!';  <br /> <br />     
        
        function inner() {  <br />           
        const inside = 'Inside!';  <br />           
        console.log(outside);   <br />          
        console.log(inside);  <br />     
    }      <br /> 
        console.log(outside);    <br />   
        inner();<br /> 
    }<br /> 
    The output will be:<br /> 
    outer()<br /> 
    << Outside!Inside!Outside!</p>
