    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>

    <p>One of the most interesting things I learned in chapter 3 is about Loops. 
        Loops will repeat a piece of code over and over again according to certain 
        conditions. I can use "while", "do-while", and "for" loops, each one of 
        these with its own syntax. I got "for" loops very useful in order to execute 
        a piece of code over the elements in an array.</p>

    <p>In chapter 4 I learned about functions. Functions can be very useful in order 
        to avoid rewriting the same code over and over again. Also, we can keep the 
        code neat and clean. It is important to know that a function must aim to perform 
        a single task. I also learned how to pass values/variables through functions and 
        return results. This is the syntax for a simple function:

        function hello(){       console.log('Hello World!');}</p>
