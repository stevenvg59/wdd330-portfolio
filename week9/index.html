    <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>

    <p>BOM stands for Browser Object Model which allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. 
        The window object is the global object in a browser environmnet. Every browser window, 
        tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object. The window object is supported by 
        all browsers and it represents the browser's window. The great thing about this is that 
        through this object we can access all the information we want from the browser, such 
        as knowing what browser is being used (navigator property), what is the URL of the 
        current page (location property), or see the history of pages visited (history property). 
        Window object allows us manipulate the window using the open(), close(), moveTo(), 
        resizeTo(). Also, we can see the information about the screen using the window.screen 
        object such as the width and height of the screen.</p>
    
    <p>As the textbook says "Each window object contains a document object. This object has 
        properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window." 
        The document object allows us to have access to any element in the HTML page and we 
        can find, change, add, and delete elements using the proper properties (e.g. document.write, 
        document.getElementById, document.createElement, document.innerHTML, and more).</p>
    
    <p>This chapter also covers Timing functions and Animations. We can use a setTimeOut and the 
        setInterval methods for animations.</p>
    
    <p>  //First we get the square from the document page<br />
        const squareElement = document.getElementById('square');<br />
        //Then, we create a variable for the angle of the square<br />
        let angle = 0;<br />
        //Using the setInterval<br />
        setInterval( () => {<br />      
        //We manipulate the angle variable increasing it by two and after<br />
        //getting 360 we reset to 0<br />
        angle = (angle + 2) % 360;<br />
        //We change the style of the square and setting its angle.<br />
        squareElement.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`<br />
        //This means 60 frames per second<br />
        }, 1000/60);</p>
        
    <p>There is a requestAnimationFrame method that performs the same as the setInterval method 
        but gets a smoother performance.</p>
