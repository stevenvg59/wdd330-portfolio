    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>

    <p>Warnings, at the beginning I used to think that if I got warnings (not errors) 
        I was just fine. However,  it can be problematic, since the issue that produced 
        the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.</p>
    
    <p>This reading help me understand the importance of debugging, honestly I've never 
        liked the idea of testing but as the book suggests "Failing silently makes errors 
        difficult to spot and longer to track down." I understand that it's like having 3 
        unidentifying errors instead of 10 indentifying and located errors.</p>
    
    <p>Learning about debugging using the browser reminded me one of my teammates because 
        he uses the console every time we test our code. He also uses the alert() method to 
        see if that part of the code executes what we want to. It's something I will start 
        using because many times I write many lines of code and when I run the program I got 
        errors that I don't know where exactly are or what exactly they mean. Using the 
        debugging tools learned in this chapter will help me figure out very quick how I can 
        prevent those errors.</p>
